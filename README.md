Introduction:

The world of entertainment has been revolutionized with the advent of streaming platforms, and Disney+ has emerged as a key player in this landscape. With its extensive collection of movies and TV shows, including classic Disney animations, Marvel superhero stories, Star Wars sagas, and much more, Disney+ has captured the hearts of audiences around the globe. In this data analysis project, we delve into the treasure trove of Disney+ content to gain insights into its offerings, trends, and audience preferences.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Disney+ content dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and statistics. By leveraging the power of Python programming and data visualization libraries, we aim to answer intriguing questions about the content available on Disney+ and provide a comprehensive overview of its diversity and popularity.
Dataset:

We'll be working with a dataset that contains information about various movies and TV shows available on Disney+. The dataset includes details such as title, type (movie/TV show), release year, country of origin, content ratings, duration, genres, and more. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis, enabling us to draw valuable insights from the vast collection of Disney+ content.

Approach:

Our analysis will follow these key steps:

Data Loading and Preparation: We'll start by loading the dataset, examining its structure, and performing necessary data cleaning and preprocessing. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.
Genre Trends: We'll analyze the most popular genres and how they've changed over the years. This involves visualizing genre distributions and potentially identifying emerging trends.

Content Ratings: We'll investigate the distribution of content ratings, helping us understand the target audience for different pieces of content.

Duration Analysis: We'll examine the distribution of content durations and analyze any patterns or outliers.

Conclusion and Insights: Finally, we'll summarize our findings, highlighting interesting trends, insights, and takeaways from the analysis.

Tools Used:

For this project, we'll utilize the Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

By conducting this exploratory data analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of Disney+ content, its growth trajectory, and the preferences of its audience, contributing valuable insights to the dynamic world of streaming entertainment.
